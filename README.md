The Car Switchbox Emulator project simulates the behavior of a car’s switchbox, specifically designed for controlling a stepper motor. Whether you’re a hobbyist, a student, or an automotive enthusiast, this project provides an educational and hands-on experience in both hardware and software development.

Features
Gear Shifting Simulation: The emulator mimics gear changes (P, R, N, D) by translating user input into motor control signals.
Realistic Feel: Tactile feedback during gear shifts provides a more authentic experience.
Customizable: Adapt the code to your specific stepper motor and switchbox setup.
Getting Started
Hardware Setup:
Connect your stepper motor to the appropriate pins on your microcontroller (e.g., Arduino).
Set up any additional components (buttons, LEDs, etc.) for user interaction.
Software Setup:
Install the Arduino IDE (if not already done).
Open the sketch_nov07a.ino file in the IDE.
Code Overview:
The main logic resides in the loop() function.
Handle user input (e.g., button presses) to simulate gear changes.
Adjust timing and motor control parameters as needed.
Upload to Microcontroller:
Compile the code and upload it to your microcontroller.
Monitor the serial output for debugging and status messages.
Usage
Power On:
Connect power to your microcontroller.
The emulator initializes in a default state (e.g., neutral gear).
User Interaction:
Press buttons (simulating gear shifts) to control the stepper motor.
Observe the motor’s behavior and any associated indicators (LEDs, displays, etc.).
Experiment and Learn:
Experiment with different gear sequences.
Modify the code to add features like reverse lights or gear position displays
